I would like to collect more knowledge in my field. It's always a pleasure for me to get more knowledge. I always believe in "the more you learn the more you realize". So, using my field's knowledge I shall do something big for my people and for my country. Even coding is a passion for me. I always spent lots of time in coding. Thinking about different problems and their solution, are fun to me. And I know the AWS community is one of the best communities in globally.  I also participate in a different program in AWS. So, it's going to be a big part for me if I can do this thing again.
