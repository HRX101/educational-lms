Step1:we have to make training model and for that have to create two files 
step2:File will be input and output (output file is json)
step3: the output file contained all the respective answers or the other part of the conversation
step4:then after setting answers , we have to train the model
step5:in the training model , we have to ignore special characters like "?" and "!"
whereas ,ignore_letters=["?","!"]
we have to read the json file in file ,
intents=read(json)
start for loop i=0 to length(intents),
	under the for loop another for loop starts from pattern=0 to pattern=i
		then , have to tokenize the pattern and put the tokenize value in documents 
		and it will make fresh value structures 

step6:after the training and making a fresh structures of values , it will send to main file 
step7:in the mainfile using LSTM and RNN algorithm , the program predicts the correct word 
step8:after predicting the appropriate word , program send the word to another script file
step9:The last layout script get the values from  main file which will be used as the answers of users questions 
step10:in the layout file there will be a part where user will write there question  and the question will send to main file 
step 11: mainfile sends the questions to training model file 
step12:after getting the questions , the mainfile will check if the appropriate answers are in the json file or not from training model
step13:if not mainfile will send some defualt anwers like(not understand), otherwise it will send correct answers
step14:and if we want to train our model for others or future questions , step3 will again start 
step15:end
